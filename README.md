# image-classifier
### The cifar-10 dataset contains 32x32 sized 60,000 labelled images of 10 different classes. The goal is  to build a model that would accurately classify the images into the following classes.
#### 0: Aeroplane, 1: Automobile, 2: Bird, 3: Cat, 4: Deer, 5: Dog, 6: Frog, 7: Horse, 8: Ship, 9: Truck
### I have used Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for this image classification  problem. I have used Keras with Tensor Flow backend. Initially, I was using Spyder as IDE on my local computer, but the performance was really low. Then, I switched to Google Colab and used the GPU provided by them to execute my program.
